Automated Vehicle Motion Planning

Graph Search Algorithm:The algorithm then searches for paths that meet the driving conditions in two stages:**constructing a graph** and **searching for pathways** within it.

graph construction

- [visual graph method][1]
- the Voronoi graph method
- the raster decomposition method
